## Solution Overview

    Salesforce Data cloud helps you/us unlock trapped data to build a 360-degree view of the customer every team can act on.

### How Data Cloud Works?

    Data cloud can import your data from any salesforce cloud, or provide connectors for seamless integration of AWS, SAP, Azure, GCP, Data lakes and snowflake clouds and data pipelines.
    It then harmonize the data by preprocessing/preparing and transforming the existing data and mapping it to a unified metadata model and then help resolve customer identities.
    Everything happens in real-time and then we have an Einstein AI Tryst Layer that helps provide us insights and automation across every customer touch point.

    or in simple words use any source of data(sap, oracle, IBM, GCP, AWS, Snowlake etc) to import the data and map it on a unified metadata fraework on data cloud to trigger any action on CRM and beyond.
