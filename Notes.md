# Notes

## User Experience

    Salesforce has two types of UX that are as follows:
    1. Salesforce Classic: Only UX available till 2014.
    2. Salesforce Lightning: Modern UX, that uses a combination of different elements/components to achieve higher productivity.

### UX Development

    To Develop Salesforce Classic UX we have to use **Visualforce**.

    To Develop Salesforce Lightning UX we have two options, **Aura components** and **Lightning Web Components**.

#### Aura Components

    Created in 2014, was proprieties's by salesforce, is quite mature and based on an internal frameword.

#### Lightning Web Component

    Created in 2018, based on new web standard or stack, natively available in your web browser.
    Therefore much faster than the aura components.


### Backend

    Salesforce uses Oracle DB as it's backend but it ain't open to get interacted.
    We will be using objects and their apis to update that db.
    Salesforce has its own programming language called Apex, which is used to perform CRUD on the tables i.e. objects.
