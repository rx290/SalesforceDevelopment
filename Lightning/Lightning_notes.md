# Introduction to Lightning

## What is lightning?

    Lightning is a User Interface framework to develop web apps for responsive mobile and desktop devices.
    It is a modern framework which is developed to create single page application with dynamic user responsive interfaces for lightning platform apps.
    It uses javascript for the client side and apex for the server side.
    It is a component based architecture, these components are reuseable 
## Why?

    There are two UIs that salesforce offers that are as follows:
    1. Salesforce Classic
    2. Lightning 


    Salesforce classic is based on aura components which are outdated and are not dynamic or responsive.

    Lightning on the other hand has responsive design and layout meaning all the component will resize/adjust themselves as per the screen size.
