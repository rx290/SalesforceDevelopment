# Salesforce

    Salesforce was founded in 1999 by Marc Benioff.
    It is a cloud based solution, which provide on Demand services.
    Salesforce provides all three solutions:
    1. SAAS: Software As A Service
    2. PAAS: Platform As A Service
    3. IAAS: Infrastructure As A Service

    All the limitations of resources of these solutions/cloud is called Governor Limits.

## How Salesforce is SAAS?

    Salesforce comes with pre-installed apps like sales, sales console, community, maket services etc & an app launcher to switch between them therefore it is considered as SAAS.

## How Salesforce is PAAS?

    It provides Developer Console, Inspector Tools and debug logs therefore it is considered as PAAS.

## How Salesforce is IAAS?

    You can check all the provided resources in Setup > storage Usage.
    As we can see how much resources we are consuming i.e. Data, files and Big object storage.
    Therefore it is considered as IAAS.
