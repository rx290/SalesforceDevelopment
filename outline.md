## Type of Developments

    There are two types of development appraches in salesforce which are as follows:
    1. Declarative Approach (Mainly uses Point & Click Tools)
    2. Programmatic Approach (Mainly uses code)

    Whenever possible always preffer delarative approach over programmatic approach, why we may ask?
    Well for code we need to keep these following things in mind:
       1. Code is optimized
       2. Test classes are written for it
       3. Make sure it is not altering/manipulating any sort of data outside of scope
   Whereas with the declarative approach we just need to test the functionality if it is working as per our expectation or not.

## Coding in salesforce

    There are different languages which can be used to code in salesforce which are as follows:
        1. Apex (Salesforce own developed compiled programming lanaugea based on java)
            We use apex to create Business logics and speaking in terms of MVC model then we use apex to write controllers.
        2. Visualforce (VF is a markup language to create custom UI)
            We use VisualForce to create UI and speaking in terms of MVC model then we use VF to write Views.
        3. Lightning (New UX Framework which is mobile friendly)
            We use lighting in two conditions which are as follows:
                1. Writing UX or user experience via modern UI (point and click)
                2. Writing controller using Javascript 

## Governor Limits

    A mechanism set in place by salesforce to provide fair share of platform useage for everyone.
