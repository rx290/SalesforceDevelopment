# Naming Convention in Apex

    1. Apex is a case-insensitive language.
    2. Always use the names declared for the variable for readability and consistency purposes.
    3. Apex Class name should be meaningful they should represent what that class is all about.
    4. The apex class name should be in pascal case meaning ever first letter of the word should be capitalize.
        Example:
            NamingConvention
            CheckPalindrome 
    5. Variables should also be named clearly and should also be meaningful.
    6. The variable name should be in camelCase meaning first word is lower case and every other word has the first word capitalized.
        Example:
            secretKey
            chamberOfSecrets
    7. All constant names should be capitalized.
        Example:
            PI
            SPEED_OF_LIGHT
    8. Starting variable or method name is forbidden.
    9. Use of special characters except for Underscores, underscores should never be used infront or intrails of your variable or method name.
    10. Variable and Classes names should be unique with respect to the scope.
